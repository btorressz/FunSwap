# FunSwap - A Simple Token Swap Contract

**FunSwap** is a Solidity-based smart contract that allows two parties to exchange two different ERC20 tokens between each other in a decentralized and secure way. The contract supports expiration handling to ensure the swap is completed within a specified timeframe, or else tokens can be recovered after the expiration. 

This project was developed for a private client and serves as an example of the custom decentralized applications I built for clients.
